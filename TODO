- Make the selection and movie list live through instances of the main activity. It's important to get this
  working before we implement adding new movies to the list or the favorites list.

- Make the detailed list activity. Make the corresponding menu button redirect to it and make items selectable.
- Set the item onclick event in the aforementioned list to pass the movie info to a new activity that
  displays the properties of the given movie in full. Create this activity too, obviously.
- Make it such that if the cover is touched, the URL is followed externally.

- Finally, the favorites list and new movie menu have to be implemented. This shouldn't be complicated.

- Add length
- Show if favorite in the selection view
