- Make the full movie info layout. Make sure it occupies a third of to half the screen and has vertical scroll.
  (That is, the scroll container itself should occupy that much)
- Use the full movie info layout to display the currently selected movie
- Make the ActionBar visibility toggle button work
- Fix the problem where the horizontal divider is too small when the screen is rotated

- Make the ActionBar menu.
- Make the detailed list activity. Make the corresponding menu button redirect to it and make items selectable.
- Set the item onclick event in the aforementioned list to pass the movie info to a new activity that
  displays the properties of the given movie in full. Create this activity too, obviously.
- Make it such that if the cover is touched, the URL is followed externally.

- Make the selection and movie list live through instances of the main activity. It's important to get this
  working before we implement adding new movies to the list.

- Finally, the favorites list and new movie menu have to be implemented. This shouldn't be complicated.
