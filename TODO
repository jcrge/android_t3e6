- Implement the menu that adds new movies:
  - onBackPressed(): confirm to cancel with a popup.
  - Add a proper cancel button, which just calls onBackPressed().
  - The new movie's details are passed through an Intent to MainActivity,
    which creates the actual Movie instance, appends it to the movies list
    and notifies browserRecyclerView about the new element.
